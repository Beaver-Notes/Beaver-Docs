Beaver Notes is a 100% open-source indie project, enjoyed by people all around the world. Our mission is to deliver a privacy-focused, easy-to-use note-taking app, and you can be part of our mission even if you are not a programmer. There are many ways to contribute to an open-source project.

# Documentation 

One of the biggest ways to contribute is by helping with our documentation. We are a small project, and the time spent documenting new features is time not spent working on them. Therefore, your help in documenting the app is truly appreciated, even if you’re not a developer. In the following guide, [Contributing to the Docs]({% post_url 2025-01-05-Contribute-to-docs %}), we’ll show you how you can assist in documenting the app and making it easier for everyone to use.

# Blog Posts

A blog is one of the best means for a project to grow and update its users on the work that is being done. Contributing to the blog means getting in touch with the developers to see what’s new, writing release articles, sharing tips and tricks, etc. In the [following guide]({% post_url 2025-01-06-Contribute-to-blog %}), we’ll show you how you can contribute to the blog.

# Code Contributions

Code is obviously a great way to contribute to the project. By hunting down bugs, fixing issues open on GitHub, or implementing new features from the roadmap, you’ll be sure to leave your mark on Beaver and its growth. Follow [this guide]({% post_url 2025-02-13-Code-Contributions %}), to set up the environment and get started. 

# Translation 

Beaver is enjoyed by people all around the world. You can help us reach even more people by helping us translate the desktop app. You could be the first to translate the app or update an existing translation. All translations are done using an open-source platform called Traduora. Check out [this page]({% post_url 2025-01-06-translate %}) to contribute to translations.

# UI and UX 

If you happen to have an eye for design, you can contribute by opening an issue on GitHub, contributing to the code, or submitting your design proposal at [danieleorolli@proton.me](mailto:danieleorolli@proton.me).
