Rather than relying solely on an internal translation team, we invite you to contribute by submitting translations effortlessly, even without technical expertise. To help new translators get started, we've created this translation guide.  

# Using Traduora  

Our apps are translated using Traduora, an Open Translation Management Platform. To submit a translation, email us at [danielerolli@proton.me](mailto:danielerolli@proton.me) with the project(s) you’d like access to. No additional details are required, but feel free to include them if necessary. You’ll receive an invitation link within 24 hours. Once added, you'll need to sign up and will have editor access to the selected project(s).  

# Adding a New Term  

Click **"Add a New Term"**, then select its value from existing ones, such as `"about.description"` or `"index.archived"`. Please avoid creating new values unless they correspond to a new function or page.  

> Remember to email us or open a GitHub issue to notify us, so we can implement the changes in Beaver.

# Adding a New Locale  

To add a new locale, go to **Translations** and click **"New Locale"** in the top right corner. Choose from over 558 available languages, select a reference locale, and start translating.  

# Exporting and Importing  

To import a locale, select the file from your system, choose **JSON** as the format, and select the locale you're importing. To export, choose the desired locale and select **JSON** as the format.
