# Home & Archive

Both the **Home** and **Archive** sections share a similar structure, which includes:

- **Search Group**:
  - **Search Bar**: Use it to search note content, titles, or labels by typing `#label`.
  - **Label Picker**: Filter notes by labels.
  - **Order Picker**: Choose the criteria for displaying notes (alphabetical, ascending, or descending order).

- **Bookmarked Section**:
  - On the home screen, bookmarked notes are displayed in this section. Once a note is archived, the bookmark status becomes irrelevant.
- **Cards**:
  - Notes are displayed as cards showing the title, labels, and the first lines of content.
  - When hovered over, the card reveals buttons for the following actions:
    - Archive/Unarchive
    - Bookmark (only on the home screen)
    - Lock
    - Trash
